Are you interested in learning computer science but don't know where to start? Look no further than [**Crash Course Computer Science on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH2l6uzC4UEW0s7-KewFLBC1D0l6XRfye). This course provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of computer science principles, with engaging delivery by the expert host Miss Carrie Anne.

As a computer technology enthusiast, I was looking to learn the fundamental concepts of computers and the web. I stumbled upon Crash Course's Computer Science course, and it was perfect for my needs. I was able to watch the complete set of 40 videos, totaling around 8 hours of content, in just two weekends. The course is well-illustrated and presented in a fun and engaging manner.

While my goal was not to fully understand every detail of computer science, Crash Course Computer Science still delivered a decent amount of details regarding the core concepts and major events in its development history. The course also includes segments with well-produced animations and illustrations, which provide a better understanding of the concepts covered. The production team behind the course is truly brilliant, making learning computer science not only informative but also enjoyable.

The course is structured in a logical and progressive manner, starting with the basics of computer hardware and software and moving on to more complex topics such as programming languages, data structures, and algorithms. Each video covers a specific topic and builds on the concepts introduced in previous videos. Some of my most favorite videos are:

- [Boolean Logic & Logic Gates](https://youtu.be/gI-qXk7XojA)
- [Registers and RAM](https://youtu.be/fpnE6UAfbtU)
- [The First Programming Languages](https://youtu.be/RU1u-js7db8)
- [Data Structures](https://youtu.be/DuDz6B4cqVc)
- [3D Graphics](https://youtu.be/TEAtmCYYKZA)

- [Cybersecurity](https://youtu.be/bPVaOlJ6ln0)
- [Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence](https://youtu.be/z-EtmaFJieY)

What's more, the course also guides viewers to additional resources for learning more about certain concepts that are not covered in the videos. This is helpful for those who want to delve deeper into specific areas of computer science.

The host of the course, Miss Carrie Anne, expertly delivers the knowledge in a passionate and humorous way, making the learning experience even more enjoyable. Her enthusiasm is contagious, and you'll find yourself just as excited about computer science by the end of the course. One quote that stood out to me was when she explained the concept of abstraction by saying, "Abstraction is like a magic trick. You're hiding the complexity behind a simple interface."

### Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're interested in learning computer science, I highly recommend checking out Crash Course Computer Science. The course provides a comprehensive yet concise overview of computer science principles, with engaging delivery by Miss Carrie Anne. Plus, the well-produced animations and additional resources make it easy to understand and learn more about the concepts covered.
